# Bevy 2D games

Requires **`bevy-production`** layout and states. This skill covers the **2D vertical slice**.

## Unprompted defaults

| Need | Default |
|------|---------|
| Camera | Orthographic 2D camera; clear color set intentionally |
| Player | Sprite (texture from `assets/sprites/` when available) + movement in `Playing` |
| Input | WASD + arrow keys; document controls in README |
| Bounds | Keep player on-screen or on a simple ground/collider box |
| UI | Menu and optional HUD; **no baked text in art assets** (localize in engine) |
| Pixels | Prefer integer/scale-friendly settings if pixel art; otherwise HD sprites with consistent PPU |
| Names | `Name::new("Player")`, `MainCamera`, etc. |

## Vertical slice (minimum playable)

1. **Loading** — load sprite handles (or immediate if single small PNG).  
2. **MainMenu** — press Enter/Space/click → **Playing**.  
3. **Playing** — move player; Esc → **Paused** or menu.  
4. At least one **disk texture** under `assets/sprites/` once art exists (colored quad only as temporary stand-in).

## Systems

- `player_movement`: read keyboard; write `Transform` (or velocity if you add physics later).  
- Keep Y-up Bevy convention; choose top-down vs side-view **once** and stick to it for art (side-view = side sprites from `game-character-consistency`).  
- Z for draw order: background < entities < UI.

## Art pipeline

1. `game-asset-core` + (`game-character-consistency` | `game-animation-frames` | `game-tilesets` | `game-ui-icons`).  
2. Save under `assets/sprites/…` or `assets/ui/…`.  
3. Load: `asset_server.load("sprites/player.png")` (paths relative to `assets/`).  
4. Verify with **`bevy-agent-loop`** capture after run.

## Tilemaps

Prefer a maintained Bevy 0.19-compatible tilemap crate when the design needs a grid; otherwise start with a few static sprites. Seamless tiles: follow **`game-tilesets`** (2×2 composite check).

## Physics

Start without a physics crate (transform movement + simple AABB). Add physics only when jumps/collisions need it; pin a 0.19-compatible version.

## Anti-patterns

- Perspective/3D camera for a pure 2D game  
- Mixing pixel-art and HD without a scale plan  
- Huge textures without atlases when many frames exist  
- Gameplay in `Startup` only
